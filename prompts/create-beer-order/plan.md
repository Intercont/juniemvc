# Beer Order System Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed plan for implementing the beer ordering system as specified in the requirements. The implementation will follow the existing project patterns and Spring Boot best practices.

## Current Project Analysis
The current project has a well-structured implementation for the Beer entity with:
- Entity class with JPA annotations
- DTO with validation annotations
- MapStruct mapper for entity-DTO conversion
- Repository interface extending JpaRepository
- Service interface and implementation with CRUD operations
- RESTful controller with proper endpoints and status codes

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Entity Layer Implementation
1. **Update Beer Entity**
   - Add the one-to-many relationship with BeerOrderLine
   - Add the helper method to maintain bidirectional relationship if needed

2. **Create BeerOrder Entity**
   - Implement as specified in the requirements
   - Include the one-to-many relationship with BeerOrderLine
   - Add helper method to maintain bidirectional relationship

3. **Create BeerOrderLine Entity**
   - Implement as specified in the requirements
   - Include many-to-one relationships with Beer and BeerOrder

### 2. Repository Layer Implementation
1. **Create BeerOrderRepository**
   - Extend JpaRepository for basic CRUD operations
   - Add any custom query methods if needed

2. **Create BeerOrderLineRepository**
   - Extend JpaRepository for basic CRUD operations
   - Add any custom query methods if needed

### 3. DTO Layer Implementation
1. **Create BeerOrderDto**
   - Implement as specified in the requirements
   - Include validation annotations for required fields
   - Include a list of BeerOrderLineDto objects

2. **Create BeerOrderLineDto**
   - Implement as specified in the requirements
   - Include validation annotations for required fields
   - Include a reference to BeerDto for display purposes

### 4. Mapper Layer Implementation
1. **Create BeerOrderMapper**
   - Use MapStruct with Spring component model
   - Configure to use BeerOrderLineMapper for nested mappings
   - Ignore fields that should not be mapped (e.g., IDs for new entities)

2. **Create BeerOrderLineMapper**
   - Use MapStruct with Spring component model
   - Configure to use BeerMapper for nested mappings
   - Implement mapping between beerId and Beer entity
   - Ignore fields that should not be mapped

### 5. Service Layer Implementation
1. **Create BeerOrderService Interface**
   - Define methods for CRUD operations as specified in the requirements
   - Include clear method documentation

2. **Create BeerOrderServiceImpl**
   - Implement the BeerOrderService interface
   - Use constructor injection for dependencies
   - Apply @Transactional annotations with appropriate settings
   - Implement business logic for creating and updating orders
   - Handle relationships between entities properly

### 6. Controller Layer Implementation
1. **Create BeerOrderController**
   - Implement RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
   - Use proper request mappings and HTTP methods
   - Return appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Validate request bodies
   - Handle exceptions properly

### 7. Testing
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write tests for mappers
   - Write tests for service implementations
   - Use mocks for dependencies

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Write tests for repositories
   - Write tests for controllers
   - Use test data builders for consistent test data

### 8. Improvements to Existing Code
1. **Add @Transactional Annotations**
   - Add @Transactional(readOnly = true) to query-only methods in BeerServiceImpl
   - Add @Transactional to data-modifying methods in BeerServiceImpl

2. **Enhance Exception Handling**
   - Update GlobalExceptionHandler if needed for new exceptions

## Implementation Sequence
1. Update the Beer entity with the relationship to BeerOrderLine
2. Create the BeerOrder and BeerOrderLine entities
3. Create the repository interfaces
4. Create the DTO classes
5. Create the mapper interfaces
6. Create the service interfaces and implementations
7. Create the controllers
8. Write unit and integration tests
9. Improve existing code with @Transactional annotations

## Best Practices to Follow
1. **Constructor Injection**
   - Use constructor injection for all dependencies
   - Make dependencies final fields

2. **Transaction Management**
   - Apply @Transactional to service methods
   - Use readOnly=true for query-only operations

3. **Validation**
   - Apply validation annotations to DTOs
   - Provide meaningful error messages

4. **Relationship Management**
   - Use bidirectional relationships with proper mappings
   - Implement helper methods to maintain relationship consistency
   - Use lazy loading for collections

5. **API Design**
   - Follow RESTful API design principles
   - Return appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Use DTOs for all controller request/response operations

By following this plan, we will implement a robust beer ordering system that integrates well with the existing application architecture and follows Spring Boot best practices.
